## Using Hygen
Hygen is a tool we use for scaffolding out components. If you're creating a new component, create the component like so:
```bash
npx hygen component new --name SomeComponent
```

Hygen generates the base files for a new component. The benefits of Hygen consistency from component to component and making refactoring easier later (can use codemod).
