## Topo: The CabinDAO Design System

Welcome to Topo, CabinDAO's internal design system. We use this collection of
libraries and tools to build high-quality interfaces.

Topo consists of two libraries:

1. [Topo Theme](./packages/theme/README.md)
1. [Topo Components](./packages/components/README.md)

The [Topo Theme](./packages/theme/README.md) is built on top of
[Stitches](https://stitches.dev/docs/tokens) and includes all the primitives for
the CabinDAO visual identity. [Topo Components](./packages/components/README.md)
is our library of pre-built UI components.
