## Topo: The CabinDAO Design System

Welcome to Topo, CabinDAO's internal design system. We use this collection of
libraries and tools to build high-quality interfaces while maintaining brand

The Topo theming is built on top of [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) and includes all the primitives 
for the CabinDAO visual identity. Topo Components is our library of pre-built 
UI components using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction).
