# Setup Guide

1. Fork the Topo [repo][1] into your Github account.
2. Clone the forked repo to your local system.
3. Navigate to the workspace root (new project directory).
4. `yarn install` will install the theme and component libaries and dependencies.  

**NOTE**: This project implements *Workspaces* using Yarn to manage installation 
of multiple packages and their dependencies efficiently. Consult the 
[Yarn documentation][2] for details and caveats regarding workspace trees.
